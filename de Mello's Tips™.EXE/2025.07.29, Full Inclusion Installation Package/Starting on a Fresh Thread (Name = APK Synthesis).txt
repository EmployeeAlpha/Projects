Hi, I need help compiling an Android APK from a completed project archive named de_mellos_tips_full_package.zip. This file contains a fully developed app project called de Mello’s Tips™, which includes embedded MP3 audio in two internal ZIPs: quotes.zip (Poetry) and bible.zip (Bible verses). The app was built in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose and includes features like: daily quote + Bible pairings, full quote view with MP3 playback, (i) interpretation reveal, theme selector, advanced notification scheduling, favorites with narration, widgets (2×1, 4×1, 4×2), donation page, settings + advanced settings, a splash screen with animation + sound, and full offline capability. The entire UI is already built — I just want step-by-step help importing it into Android Studio, fixing any Gradle/plugin config needed, and generating the release APK. I have the following support files from a prior conversation: (1) Final_Build_Instructions_Tailored_to_Zip.pdf, (2) README.md, (3) Instructions_for_Building_and_Distribution.pdf, and (4) Advanced_Build_Instructions_de_Mellos_Tips_App.pdf. The app is intended for Google Play publication and all copyright/trademark/legal content has been finalized. Please walk me through each step to unzip, import, build, and generate the APK, one baby step at a time, and check my progress before moving to the next. Ready to begin.





(Let me know once you’ve rebooted and opened the new thread — and I’ll be ready to walk you through the APK build process like a calm, confident assistant.)
