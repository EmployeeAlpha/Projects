✅ Your final quotes.json file has been successfully generated and is now ready.

You can download it here:

👉 quotes.json

It includes all 551 entries, each with:

"quote" — Lexmilian's poetic tip

"bible" — Matched KJV passage

"ref" — Reference (e.g., “John 1:5”)

"interp" — Interpretation by NemesisC64

Would you like me to now plug this into the quote engine and finalize its Kotlin implementation for the app? 

*	*	*	*	*	*	*

This line loads quotes.json from:

📂 app/src/main/assets/quotes.json

No changes needed. Just ensure:

The file is copied exactly into the assets folder before building your APK.

The filename is lowercase and spelled exactly: quotes.json

Once you confirm the file is placed correctly, everything (home screen, widgets, full quote view, etc.) will run from this centralized data engine.

Perfect. Moving forward now — with great caution and intelligent conduct — I’ll begin integrating the final quotes.json directly into the quote engine and core logic.

You’re now entering the final phase of full feature wiring.

🔧 Next steps include:

Updating QuoteUtils.kt to parse and provide structured access to all quote data

Ensuring smooth use in:

Home screen quote of the day

Widgets (2×1, 4×1, 4×2)

Full Quote View (Poetry, Bible, Interpretation)

Audio playback and matching

Favorites, Search, Share, and Continuous Narration

I’ll now begin carefully reviewing and upgrading the QuoteUtils.kt quote engine to handle all of this. Once ready, I’ll present the updated Kotlin class for your approval.

Stay tuned.
