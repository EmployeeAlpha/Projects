⚙️ Step 1 — Use a Custom “Donation + Ownership” License

Save this as a file named LICENSE.txt or LICENSE.md at the root of your Projects repository:

de Mello & NemesisC64 Projects License — Donationware + Intellectual Property Notice
Version 1.0 (October 2025)

Copyright (c) 2025 Lexmilian de Mello and NemesisC64.
All rights reserved.

⚙️ Step 2 — Add clear headers inside each sub-project

At the top of major source files, add a small header such as:

# © 2025 Lexmilian de Mello and NemesisC64
# Licensed under the de Mello & NemesisC64 Projects License v1.0
# See LICENSE.txt for details and donation requirements.


or in other languages:

/* (c) 2025 Lexmilian de Mello and NemesisC64
   Licensed under the de Mello & NemesisC64 Projects License v1.0
   See LICENSE.txt for details and donation requirements. */

⚙️ Step 3 — Tell GitHub it’s a Custom License

Create the repo (or open its root).

Click Add file → Create new file.

Name it LICENSE.txt.

Paste the full text above.

Commit directly to main.

GitHub will display “License: Other” or “Custom”, which is fine—it simply means your license doesn’t match an OSI template.

⚙️ Step 4 — Optional refinement for sub-projects

If you ever want a sub-project to be open source, you can drop its own standard
license (e.g., MIT) into that folder.
Otherwise, all folders inherit the above proprietary/donation rule automatically.

✅ Summary

You and NemesisC64 keep 100 % of intellectual-property rights.

Anyone using the software owes a reasonable donation to your PayPal link.

GitHub will list it as Custom License.

Include the same notice in each major code file.
